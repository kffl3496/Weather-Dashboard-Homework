# Weather-Dashboard-Homework

Created a Weather Dashboard application that allows the user to search a city of their choice and get the corresponding weather forecast.  After doing so, the page stores the result into local storage and allows the user to search more cities while keeping their previous searches stored for reference.  The page uses the openweather API to get the weather forecast results.
